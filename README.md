## Pitch

1. How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
    - We'll start by going through Tensorflow's website and reading through their various guides and try to follow along with some of their beginner tutorials.
2. What is your goal with this project?
    - To train a model that can reliably identify the different recycling symbols and use that model for an app that allows users to scan the symbols they find and inform them on what it means.
3. Who is the user for your app?
    - Anyone who wants to know more about how to recycle things.
4. Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
    - Learning how to use Tensorflow
    - Using a user's phone camera for image input

## Tech Used
- Tensorflow
- Python
- Keras
- Possibly JavaScript and Node for deployment

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to upload an image of a recycling symbol.
- As a user, I want to be told which symbol I uploaded.
- As a user, I want to see more information about recycling based on the image I uploaded.
